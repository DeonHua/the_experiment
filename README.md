# the_experiment
A repository where anyone can contribute, and anything goes. Will this repo become a cool app? A terrible website? A dank meme? YOU get to decide the fate of this repository!

## Why?
I'm interested in how random people can work on something together spontaneously. Let's see how this one works out...

##Ooooh! How do I help?
You can help with the experiment by making a pull request with anything you want to do. <b>Nothing illegal or that might get me arrested please.</b>I'll just accept as many PRs as I can. If you behave yourself (or just ask) then I can add you as an contributor!
